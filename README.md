# Code-Quiz

# Description

This project is a functional code quiz that showcases the use of Web Api's, using javascript, HTML, and CSS styling. My motivation behind this prohject was to create a fun and fresh way to study my Javascript functionality and syntax, while also being able to showcase what I have learned so far in my web development bootcamp. The application itself is decently simple, with only an HTML index, a CSS stylesheet, and a Javascript script. The HTML and CSS are pretty basic, with a few sections on the HTML and a couple classes in the CSS. The Javascript is a little more complex though, although not too much. First we defined our variables and made a couple sample questions. We then made some extra questions that were thrown in there at random to mix up the questions. Afterwards we created a seventy-five second timer and a function to take off fifteen seconds from the remaining time if an incorrect answer is chosen. From there we added functions to save results, and add initials to the highscore board; with a function to take off the saved high-scores as well. 

# Usage

The application is titled Code-Quiz and opens up to a blank page with a purple button that says "start quiz". When the user clicks on that button, they are prompted with a multiple choice question about Javascript with a timer counting down from seventy-five. When the user gets a question right, another question is presented to them and the clock continues clicking, however when they answer incorrectly, fifteen seconds is taken off the clock. The user continues to answer these questions until the timer gets to zero, where they are told the game is over and that they can save their initials and score to the leaderboard; and can also delete the leaderboard. They are then taken to the main menu where they can play again.
